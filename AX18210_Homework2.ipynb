    "b) By comparing the costs of the obtained paths, we have discovered that all search strategies result in an equivalent cost of 4 for effectively reaching the designated goal state. This may be attributed to the fact that only one possible path leads to the goal state, thereby causing all search strategies to locate the same path and thus incur the exact cost. However, upon comparing the number of cycles required to reach the goal state, it was found that Breadth-First Search took the least amount with only 7 cycles, while Depth-First Search took the highest number of cycles at 15. In addition, Greedy-Best-First required only 9 cycles to reach the goal state, while A* Search took 10 cycles. From the cycle count, it seems like BFS explored the search space in a systematic and comprehensive manner, ensuring that all possible paths were explored before reaching the goal state. Whereas, DFS may have explored fewer paths and may have gotten stuck in local optima.  Greedy-Best-First was able to efficiently navigate the search space by evaluating the most promising paths first. Whereas, A* also performed well and striked a balance between being comprehensive like BFS and efficient like Greedy-Best-First."

    "B) By comparing the costs of the paths obtained in each algorithm, it was observed that both Breadth-First Search and A* star search algorithms could identify the most optimal path, with each requiring a cost of 5 to reach the goal state. However, the Depth-First Search algorithm exhibited a higher cost of 31, indicating sub-optimal performance. Additionally, the Greedy-best-first algorithm with heuristic 1 incurred a cost of 7 to reach the goal state. However, with heuristic, 2 it incurred a cost of 5. This implies that the Manhattan distance heuristic used in the Heuristic 2 function is more optimal than the Hamming distance heuristic used in Heuristic 1. A* star algorithm with both heuristics functions achieved a cost of 5 suggesting that the agent needs to take at least a minimum of 5 actions to reach the goal state.\n"
